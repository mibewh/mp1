Position Indicator: Indicator of the current reading position visible in the navigation bar (see above gif for example). Make sure your implementation highlights the last menu item when you scroll to the bottom of the page. ( Implementation Tip : To figure out which menu item to highlight, you'll have to figure out which section lies directly below the bottom margin of the navigation bar. You can use methods that give you the height and position of different divs to figure that out. You will want to recompute this whenever there is a scroll event.)
